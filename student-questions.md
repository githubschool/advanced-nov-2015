How can I setup atom as a good merge tool?
[atom merge plugin](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts)

How can I enforce column width for commit messages so they don't flow off the terminal window?

With force push, are the overwritten commits still somewhere on the remote?
when do things actually get removed and deleted for good, on my machine and on the remote?  
How do i get to dangling commits on a remote?

When you rebase and hit a conflict and resolve, where is that change applied?  at the end on the last commit or on each commit?

Similar to push "matching" is there a way to automatically pull from all branches at once, assuming they can all fast forward?
